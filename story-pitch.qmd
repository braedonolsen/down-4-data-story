## Pitch

Have you noticed teams going for it on fourth down more often? If so, your eyes are not deceiving you. With the rise in analytics used for in-game strategy and decision-making, college football teams are attempting fourth down conversions at unprecedented rates. Coaches who historically would have sent out the punt team on a 4th-and-2 are now scheming aggressive quarterback sneaks or trick plays to scrap for an extra set of downs. The numbers, whose hold on college football coaches is almost hypnotic, now dictate the strategy. For this story, I'd like to examine how the volume of fourth down conversion attempts in college football has shifted over the last 5-10 years. I would also aim to determine whether the success rate of these attempts has changed, and if so, what factors could be responsible.


## Data

My primary data source will be the online source [College Football Data](https://collegefootballdata.com/) (CFBD). CFBD offers free, relatively clean data on several aspects of college football via APIs and pre-built packs. For this story, I requested and received an API key from CFBD, which I will use to ensure I have the most up-to-date data possible. Luckily, since this year's college football season is complete, I will not have to worry about new data being added as I work on the project. However, if that were to be the case, all I would need to do to get the updated data would be to rerun the code that loads in the dataset.

Through my initial exploration of CFBD and the data I can access, I am under the impression that I can only grab data for one season at a time. Thus, in order to compare fourth down rates over several seasons, I will either need to join several datasets, or complete an exploratory data analysis on each dataset for each year I examine. I am leaning towards the former, as it stands out as a more convenient option. However, I am keeping the door open for the latter option if the former causes issues.


## Sources

The hope for this story is that the data itself does the bulk of the storytelling. However, I do plan to consult industry experts as well to get an inside look into the shifting fourth down strategy that has permeated college football. One such expert is Michael McRoberts, a Northwestern graduate who wrote a compilation of football strategies called “The Game Book.” The book, used by over 100 college football programs, contains strategies for various aspects of football, including when to go for it on fourth down. I first learned about McRoberts after reading a piece that The Wall Street Journal wrote on him called “The Suburban Dad Who Calls Plays for 100 College Football Teams." As he is a Northwestern alum, I will be able to contact him through the alumni database.

In addition to McRoberts, it would be constructive to talk to college football coaches or assistants. I would welcome their perspective as to *why* their teams are attempting fourth down conversions more often (or why they are not, if that is the case). I am less confident in landing one of these interviews, as I am unsure as to whether teams would openly share their in-game strategies with a journalist.


## Flags

I am generally confident in my ability to produce a timely, engaging, and digestible story regarding fourth down strategy in college football. Based on my initial skim of the data I'd be working with, it seems like the information is mostly complete and accurate, which is critical for the story to be of any use.

One issue I am grappling with is explaining the *why* regarding my topic. Through data wrangling and quantitative analysis, I am confident that I can illustrate the trend of teams going for it more often on fourth down. However, the data alone cannot explain why that is the case. In a perfect world, I would lean on outside sources and interviews to supply me with this information. However, given the tight turnaround for the story and the general coyness of many of these coaches, I am not extremely confident that I can land an interview in due time. This is an issue I am working to solve, and I am actively brainstorming ideas for how to address it if I cannot land an interview.
