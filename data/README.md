# College Football Data

This repository contains the filtered dataset I used to complete my analysis and story. The data came from the online source [College Football Data](https://collegefootballdata.com/) (CFBD). CFBD offers free, relatively clean data on several aspects of college football via APIs and pre-built packs. For this story, I requested and received an API key from CFBD.

## Data

- `down_4_plays`: filtered dataset from CFBD play-by-play data; only includes 4th-down plays from 2016-2025 regular seasons
